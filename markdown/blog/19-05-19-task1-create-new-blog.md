This article is for an IPFS boilerplate that I'm working on. I am currently creating a new markdown file under blogs with the latest date.

Will it appear as a latest blog?
![Latest Blog](images/showed-as-latest-blog.png 'Available as a latest blog')
<br />
Will this be queryable in graphql?

Will it create another blog page?
